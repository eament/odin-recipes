        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Celebrating apple season with these Sweet and Salty Healthier Caramel Apples. Crisp autumn apples dipped into homemade salted maple “caramel”. Made with 5 simple ingredients, 6 if you love a little chocolate – which we do. Real maple syrup, honey, cream, and vanilla. Each caramel apple is dipped or drizzled with chocolate and finished off with a pinch of flaky sea salt. Zero processed sugars! A yummy, wholesome twist on a classic fall treat. Fun for both Halloween and Thanksgiving to come.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 small apples</li>
            <li>1 cup pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 cup honey (additional maple, if vegan)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup heavy cream (canned coconut cream, if vegan)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean powder</li>
            <li>melted chocolate, for drizzling (optional)</li>
            <li>flaky sea salt (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Insert wooden skewers or twigs into the apples. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium pot, combine the maple syrup, honey, and cream. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil 10-12 minutes or until thickened to a caramel-like sauce. It should easily coat the back of a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla and a pinch of sea salt.</li>
            <li>Very carefully transfer the caramel to a heat-proof bowl.</li>
            <li>Working quickly, swirl the apples in the caramel, then place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining apples. If the caramel stiffens too much to dip, warm for 15-20 seconds in the microwave to loosen it back up.</li>
            <li>Let the caramel set, about 10-15 minutes, then dip/drizzle each apple with melted chocolate. Let the chocolate harden, then enjoy! The apples will keep in the fridge for about 1 week.</li>
            
        </ol>
