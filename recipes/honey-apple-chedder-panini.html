        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This honey, apple, cheddar, and bacon Panini is high on my Monday “to-do” list.</p>
        <p>And with good reason. We all know that around here, I like to keep Mondays fun, different, and delicious. Trust me when I say, this apple Panini fits the bill. I’m even going to go out and say that if you make this today, you’re going to have a pretty darn good (err delicious?) Monday.</p>
